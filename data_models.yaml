Request from iPhone to Backend

iphone_data : {
  "type":"credit/debit",
  "amount":400,
  "category":"food/rent/etc.",
  "vendor": "Lucky Goat",
  "location":{
    "lat":lat,
    "long":long
  }
}

Each month there will need to be a new csv

How do we automate monthly transactions?
- use threading to run a service every month
- every day, run a function on the server that will update the global time stamp variable
- whenever the month for the new timestamp differs from the month from the old timestamp then run a function that will put 
  all the monthly charges in a new csv
